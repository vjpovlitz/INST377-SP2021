        <p>
            Let's make an unordered list.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hunter x Hunter for the story and lesssons.</li>
            <li>My Hero Academia for the characters and fighting.</li>
            <li>Demon Slayer for the plot and imagery.</li>
        </ul>    
        Add an unordered list element
        nest each item inside the unordered list in a list tag
        List elements can be in any order
        
        And now, one in order.
        
        Add an ordered list element.
        Add your top five music albums in order to the list.
        Check it out, numbers by default.
        
        Inline elements
        
        Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.
        
        Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text.
        
        Sometimes you want to do both.
        
        Empty Elements
        
        Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
        
        Add a hard line under here.
        
        This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.
